## <center> Hello World! </center>

By "World", I mean the approximately 6 or so friends who are likely to look at this.

This site was first created on August 20, 2017, in about 10 minutes.  However, before that 10 minutes, I spent a few hours attempting to figure out some problem with the structure of my directories that prevented the site from building the site properly.

This is a work in progress, so while there's very little on it now, it will soon contain interesting stuff. Or boring stuff, I guess, depending on what you find interesting or boring. At any rate, it will at least contain stuff! By the way, if you're here, you'll have noticed the domain extension is ".com", but once I become a resident of the greatest city that has ever existed in the history of the universe, it will be ".nyc".
